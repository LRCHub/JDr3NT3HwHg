(Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again
I'll live again)

This world is not my own
Someday I'll be gone
I'm making preparations
From a final destination

I'll be buried in the ground
But can a grave not hold me down
Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again (live again)

I'll live again (I'll live again)
I'll live again (I'll live again)
Oh Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again

I'm gonna lay this body down
I'll be buried in the ground
Oh Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again

I live in a beautiful dimension
Not made by man
Prepared by God, the Father
Over in the promised land
The streets are paved with gold
In the homeland of the soul
Oh praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again (I'll live again)

I'll live again (I'll live again)
I'll live again (I'll live again)
Oh Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again

I'm gonna lay this body down
I'll be buried in the ground
Oh Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again

I'll live again (I'll live again)
I'll live again (I'll live again)
I Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again

I'm gonna lay this body down
I'll be buried in the ground
Oh Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again (live again)

I'll live again (I'll live again)
I'll live again (I'll live again)
Oh Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again
I'm gonna lay this body down
I'll be buried in the ground
Oh Praise the Lord
I'll rise and live again
