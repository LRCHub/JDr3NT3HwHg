Live again and
Love again
They tell me

Smile again and
Laugh again
They tell me

So now you'll find me where
The lights are bright
Every night
I'm having fun
I dance and drink with everyone

I'm running here, there
Trying to forget you
No, no
No matter who I may be with
I love you

Live again and
Love again
They tell me

Sing again
And dance again
They tell me

So now you'll find me where there's
Lots of noise
With the boys!
I get around
They know my name all over town

I'm running here, there
Trying to forget you
No, no
No matter who I may be with
I love you

How long must I be
Be with someone else
When I love you
